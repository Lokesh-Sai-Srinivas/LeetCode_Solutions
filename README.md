# 🌱 My LeetCode Growth Journey

Welcome to my little coding garden 🌿 — a place where I plant one LeetCode problem a day, water it with code 💻, and watch my skills grow over time. 🌸

This repo is my personal log of:
- 📅 **Daily Challenges** (to stay consistent)
- 🔢 **Number-wise Problems** (starting at #1 and climbing upwards)

I solve problems in **Python 🐍**, **Java ☕**, and **C++ ⚡** for now. More languages will join the garden later. 🚀
