# 🌱 My LeetCode Growth Journey

Welcome to my little coding garden 🌿 — a place where I plant one LeetCode problem a day, water it with code 💻, and watch my skills grow over time. 🌸

This repo is my personal log of:
- 📅 **Daily Challenges** (to stay consistent)
- 🔢 **Number-wise Problems** (starting at #1 and climbing upwards)

I solve problems in **Python 🐍**, **Java ☕**, and **C++ ⚡** for now. More languages will join the garden later. 🚀

## 📝 Commit Messages

I like to keep things clean, so my commit messages follow this style:

```

\[Daily] YYYY-MM-DD: Problem Name
\[Python] #0001: Two Sum
\[Java]   #0001: Two Sum
\[Cpp]    #0001: Two Sum

```

This way I always know what’s what at a glance 👀

## 🌟 My Goals

- 🌍 Add more languages (Go, Rust, JavaScript... who knows?)
- 🏷️ Tag each solution with **difficulty** (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- 🤖 Automate progress updates in this README
- ✨ Keep this repo fun, friendly, and inspiring

## 💡 A Note to Myself (and maybe you 👋)

> "Consistency beats intensity. One problem a day might look small now, but in a year — it’s 365 problems solved." 🌟

Let’s keep coding and keep growing! 🌱💻
