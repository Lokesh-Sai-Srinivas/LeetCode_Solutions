# 🌱 My LeetCode Growth Journey

Welcome to my coding garden 🌿  
This repository is a **long-term, consistency-driven log** of my LeetCode problem-solving journey — focused on learning, discipline, and steady improvement.

I solve **at least one problem a day** and let automation handle everything else.

---

## 🚀 What This Repository Is About

- 📅 **Daily LeetCode Challenges** (tracked by date)
- 🔢 **Problem-wise Solutions** (easy lookup by problem number)
- 🌐 **Multi-language implementations**
- 🤖 **Fully automated progress tracking**

Currently solving in:
**Python 🐍 | Java ☕ | C++ ⚡**  
(More languages will be added over time.)

## 🧠 Commit Message Style

I follow a simple, readable commit format:

```

[Daily] 2025-01-01: Power of Three
[Python] #0326 Power of Three
[Java]   #0326 Power of Three
[C++]    #0326 Power of Three

```

This keeps the Git history clean and meaningful.

## 🌍 Designed for the Future

This repository is **language-agnostic by design**.

- Adding a new language requires **no restructuring**
- Progress tables adapt automatically
- Scripts detect languages dynamically

Planned additions:
- 🦀 Rust
- 🐹 Go
- 🌐 JavaScript / TypeScript
- …and more

## 🌟 Long-Term Goals

- 📊 Rich progress analytics
- 🏷 Difficulty & topic tracking
- 🤖 Zero manual maintenance
- ✨ Clean, readable, recruiter-friendly codebase

## 💬 A Note to Myself (and You)

> **“One problem a day seems small — until a year passes.”**

Let’s keep building, learning, and growing 🌱💻
